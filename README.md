# 🛑 AntiWikipedia

A lightweight web app that stores, displays, and searches **all wrong explanations** in a clean and responsive interface.  
Unlike Wikipedia’s “latest edits” view, AntiWikipedia shows **every explanation** ever added, all in one place.
This Includes The System Than Allows You To Add ur Custom Explanation **MAKE SURE ITS WRONG** And It Will Be Stored In Thid Forever.. I also Added A Dark Mode ..... This Site Is Ambient With Slutter Free Experience . This Also Includes Multiple Icons For Diff Representations......
